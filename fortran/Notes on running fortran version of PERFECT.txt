If you run PERFECT with the -help flag, a bunch of command-line options are printed out. All of these options are 
associated withe the PETSc library. 

The documentation for the PETSc library can be found here:
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-current/docs/index.html

The default Krylov solver in the fortran version of PERFECT is BiCGStab(l), and it is set in solveDKE.F90 with the command
call KSPSetType(KSPInstance, KSPBCGSL, ierr)
You can change the solver without recompiling using the command-line option
-ksp_type <solvername>
Probably the only other solver you might consider trying is GMRES, which you invoke using the command-line flags
-ksp_type gmres
To see the list of all available solvers, you can run PERFECT with the -help flag, and look for the lines about -ksp_type.
