PERFECT needs closed flux surfaces. When modelling an experiment the buffer region may need to
extend beyond psiN=1, so we need to extrapolate in a way that does not have an X-point.

Chosen algorithm: 
- along lines of constant poloidal angle (from the magnetic axis) extrapolate psiN
  linearly outside of some chosen value, extrapolateBeyondPsiN in the EFITOptions.m file.
- get the gradient for the linear extrapolation from some psiN range, extrapolatePsiNInterval in the
  EFITOptions.m file.

Implementation:
- create a fine r-theta grid (1024 points in each direction) centred on the magnetic axis, with a
  large enough maximum r to include the entire cartesian grid in the geqdsk file.
- interpolate psiN onto the r-theta grid using interp2
- for each theta:
  - find the largest psiN below extrapolateBeyondPsiN
  - extrapolate linearly for larger r
- interpolate back to the cartesian grid using interp2
- recalculate psi from psiN so that BR, BZ, etc. get calculated using the extrapolated field.
- set I to constant from extrapolateBeyondPsiN outwards.
- continue with the usual flux surface reconstruction, but now psiMax can be greater than 1
