It is useful, especially for global PERFECT runs, to have a non-uniform grid in psiN. This is now
implemented in the matlab geometry generation scripts.
The array of psiN values on which to output the geometry is specified in an HDF5 file, whose name is
input in the psiNFile option in EFITOptions.m. The array is called psiNArray in a group labelled by
the value of Npsi, e.g. 'Npsi100'.
